## Exercise sheet 3

1. **Permanent pycnocline:** (3 points) Plot the profiles of temperature, salinity and potential temperature ($\theta$) for the same profile as used in Exercise sheet 3.  You will want to continue with JOA for DPO Example 3C and 3D: [JPA for DPO 3](https://joa.ucsd.edu/dpo/dpo_joa_examples/chapter_3/3c.html).  Indicate on your plot where the permanent pycnocline is.


2. **Watermass analysis:** A hydrographic observation in the eastern North Atlantic has revealed a potential temperature of T=8.2$^\circ$C and a salinity of S=35.45 g/kg. The water types are assumed to be: Mediterranean Water (MW) with T=11$^\circ$C and S=36.2 g/kg, North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) with 3$^\circ$C and 34.8 g/kg and East Atlantic Subpolar Intermediate Water (EASIW) with 9$^\circ$C and 35.3 g/kg.

    - [1 point] Plot the 4 pairs of values on a TS diagram to see whether the observed properties can arise from mixing of the three types of spring water
    - [3 points] If so, determine the relative proportions of these three spring waters in the observation.
    - [3 points] Investigate the sensitivity of these percentages when the observation may
contain errors of  $\epsilon_T$ = 0.03 K and $\epsilon_S$ = 0.02  g/kg.


3. **Age of a watermass:**  The radioactive decay of Tritium ($^3$H)  to Helium ($^3$He) is described by

	$${d \over dt} {^3H}  = - \lambda \cdot {^3H} $$

    where $\lambda$ is the decay rate. The half-life is 12.3 years. In the surface layer the helium escapes into the atmosphere, but below it accumulates. The "ventilation age" can therefore be determined from the ratio $^3$He/$^3$H.
    - [1 point] What is the solution to the differential equation?
    - [3 points] Derive an equation for age as a function of $^3$He/$^3$H. Assume that there is no helium in the surface layer at the subduction time. 
    - [1 point] What is the age of two water bodies in which the ratio of $^3$He/$^3$H = 1.67 and $^3$He/$^3$H = 0.5, respectively.
