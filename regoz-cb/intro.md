# BSc Regional Oceanography

This is a module on regional oceanography.  It builds on what was covered in Introduction to Physical Oceanography, but with a stronger focus on the physical properties of seawater, how those properties are changed, and how those properties can be used to calculate the stratification and circulation of seawater.  We will also look at how different properties and processes are active in regions of the world's oceans.
