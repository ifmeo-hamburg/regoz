## Overview

<!---  Course Outline: The approach of the course will follow a general sequence of themes that will 1) introduce the notion of the Earth as a “water-planet”, 2) set the boundaries of ocean basins (upper and lower limits), and describe the properties of the water element (physical and chemical), 3) put in motion the oceanic system (horizontal and vertical circulation), --->

### Aims & Learning objectives

This is a module on regional oceanography.  It builds on what was covered in Introduction to Physical Oceanography, but with a stronger focus on the physical properties of seawater, how those properties are changed, and how those properties can be used to calculate the stratification and circulation of seawater.  We will also look at how different properties and processes are active in regions of the world's oceans.

The aim of this course is to:

1) describe hydrography and circulation in different parts of the world's oceans, highlighting similarities and differences,

2) quantify the surface heat, freshwater and momentum fluxes

3) explain the vertical structure of the water column,

4) illustrate ocean dynamcis by means of regional examples


**Learning objectives:** At the end of this module, you should be able to 

1. Use hydrographic properties (temperature and salinity) of seawater to explain the vertical structure of the ocean and to identify watermasses. (Physical description of the sea)

2. Summarise the major processes by which physical ocean properties and circulation are set or changed, including describing the major surface and deep currents in the oceans and explaining their causes. (Processes of change)

3. Outline the distinguishing characteristics (properties, circulation patterns, processes) of different regional oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, Southern Ocean and marginal seas). (Regional Oceanography)



### Expected student background

This is a course intended for Bachelor students of oceanography and geophysics (typically in their 4th semester).  It is also suitable as an elective or supplementary module for geography, meteorology, geology, hydro-biology or other earth sciences.



### Assessment

Your grade will be based on the final exam and coursework (exercises).

Your grade in the class will be determined as the highest calculation:
1. Coursework 20% + Final exam 80%
2. Final exam 100%

You should plan at the start of the course whether it will be advantageous to you to complete the coursework component of the assessment.  However, you do not need to make a decision - I will use the calculation which gives you the highest score.

#### Coursework/ Exercises

Exercises/coursework are due during the term, with 5 pieces of assigned exercise sheets.  This work can be discussed with others, but must be completed individually and turned in online.  Each piece of coursework will have one exercise which is computer-based (python).

Generally, exercise sheets will be available in the middle of the week, with one exercise session to work on them in class.  Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due Fridays at noon, online on the course Moodle.

<!--
#### Mini-project (group)

 A mini-project of your choice will be completed during the term and due in the final week of class.  You may choose between
- Presentation on a regional ocean and process of your choice, in English.  Presentations should be 5-8 minutes long.   Presentations will be graded for style (organisation, slide layout and legibility) and content (accuracy and suitability of material), but not for English language or grammar.
- Data project with individual or group* presentation, written report (about 3-5 pages, double spaced of text, and 2-4 pages of figures).  The grade will be based on the written report.  Reports will be graded for style (organisation at the report and paragraph level, figure legibility) and content (accuracy and suitability of material, choice of data plots to show), but not for English language or grammar.  *Expectations for content will be higher if group.
-->

#### Final exam

We currently plan for the final exam to be written.  If written, it will be in English and part multiple choice and part problem-based, with problems similar to the coursework/exercise sheets provided in class (but without any computer-based exercises).  It may span two sessions (2 x 1.5 hours).

**Late exercises:**

The good news is, you can turn in your answers to an exercise sheet late (up to 5 days late).  The bad news is, you will lose points (10% for each day late).   So if you turn it 1-24 hours after the deadline, your score on the assignment will be multiplied by 0.9, if you turn it in 24-48 hours after the deadline, your score will be multipled by 0.8).  After 5 days, it is not possible to turn in a late assignment as we will go over the solutions in the next Uebungen.

If you have a good reason (such as being sick) for being unable to complete an assignment in time, please let us know as soon as is practicable.

### Resources 

A recommended reading list for the course.  See assigned readings on the [syllabus](../syllabus).

#### Books

A comprehensive resource for this course is:

-   Talley et al. (2011) - Descriptive Physical Oceanography (DPO) is available with full text access from the Univ. Hamburg website.  This link may or may not work:  [UHH library: full text access](https://katalogplus.sub.uni-hamburg.de/vufind/Record/679005536?rank=1).  You will want chapters 2-5, 9, 10, 12-13.

Note that for DPO chapter 7, we will use the extended supplementary edition available from the publisher's website here:
