    "# Python Introductory lab\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directions:** \n",
    "Follow the instructions on this worksheet and write your answers as you go along.   If you have any trouble, check to be sure you followed the instructions.  If you still need assistance, ask an instructor during the timetabled exercise session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aim:** This practical assumes *no prior Python knowledge*.  By following the steps below, you'll learn how to access Python, how to load some simple `*.nc` files, and carry out basic calculations. We'll introduce the concepts of scalars, vectors and matrices in Matlab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning outcomes:** At the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load data into Python (e.g. `csv`-files containing numerical values only).\n",
    "2. Create variables in Python from numbers, i.e. simple *scalars*, *vectors* (using the colon, `:`) and *matrices*, so that you can perform calculations on the variables after.\n",
    "3. Perform simple averages of the data and arithmetic operations, using  functions `mean`, `median`, `sin`,  operators `-`, `*`, and `/`, and transpose vectors and matrices using apostrophe, `'`.\n",
    "4. Use Matlab commands `load` and `whos` to investigate files and variables, and see how the special character, semicolon, `;`, works in Matlab to suppress output to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Use the `data_vector.csv` and `data_matrix.csv` data files, available on Moodle. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check your answers:** This is a formative assessment rather than summative (i.e. the results here do not contribute to your mark in the course).  Answers will be available for you to check on Blackboard.    "
